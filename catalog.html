        <h2>Chicken Curry</h2>
        <p>
          Chicken Curry (Kukul Mas Curry) is a classic Sri Lankan dish featuring
          tender chicken pieces cooked in a flavorful blend of spices and
          coconut milk. The curry is infused with the aromatic combination of
          cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, creating a rich and satisfying taste.
          The addition of tomatoes and a medley of spices enhances the depth of
          flavor, resulting in a hearty and delicious curry. It's commonly
          served with rice or roti.

        <h2>Dhal Curry</h2>
        <p>
          Dhal Curry (Parippu Curry) is a comforting and nutritious lentil dish
          that is a staple in Sri Lankan cuisine. Red lentils are cooked to
          perfection and infused with a tempering of mustard seeds, cumin, and
          curry leaves. The addition of turmeric and chili powder provides a
          warm and mildly spicy flavor. This wholesome dish is often served with
          rice and complements other Sri Lankan curries beautifully.

        <h2>Coconut Sambal</h2>
        <p>
          Coconut Sambol (Pol Sambola) is a vibrant and zesty condiment that
          adds a burst of flavor to any Sri Lankan meal. Freshly grated coconut
          is combined with finely chopped red onion, green chilies, and a touch
          of lime juice. The result is a refreshing and slightly spicy sambol
          that can be enjoyed as a side dish with rice or flatbread. Its
          simplicity allows the natural sweetness of coconut to shine through.

        <h2>Egg Hoppers</h2>
        <p>
          Egg Hoppers (Appa) are a popular Sri Lankan breakfast or snack
          characterized by thin, bowl-shaped pancakes with a perfectly cooked
          egg nestled in the center. The batter, made from a combination of rice
          flour and coconut milk, ferments to achieve a unique texture and
          flavor. Hoppers are typically served with a side of spicy sambol or
          accompanied by savory curries, offering a delightful culinary
          experience.
